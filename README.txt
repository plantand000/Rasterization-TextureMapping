- No-Clipping Algorithm Implemented.

- How to Run, follow command: 
  - mkdir build 
  - cd build 
  - cmake ..
  - make -j4
  - ./Assignment3
  - Choose your model when prompted (** IMPORTANT! Texture mapping is only on the sphere)

- Commands and Functionality:
  - Use the space bar to switch between GPU (openGL code) to CPU (my built rasterization pipeline using barycentric interpolation and z_buffer algorithm)
  - '0' key : random color per triangle 
  - '1' key : random color per vertex, color is then interpolated
  - '2' key: color is attenuated based on the depth of the vertex from the original camera position
  - 'w', 's' : move closer, futher away respectively
  - 'a', 'd' : change object angle by rotating object
  - FOR SPHERE ONLY:
    - 't' : Switches to texture mapped sphere with wrap around functionality
    - 'n' : nearest nieghbor texture mapping
    - 'l' : bilinear interpolationn texture mapping
    - 'm' : mipmapped texture mapping
